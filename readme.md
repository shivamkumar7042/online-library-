# Online Library system readme.

# Description
A react based online Library application that allows the user to browse, search and filter books. They can even add new books (temporarily) till the session is running. When the page reloads the added book will not be present in the data. This project is to demonstrate redux store management, along with how a basic online library works in front-end.

# Features of the project
-Searching for the books based on title or author
-Filtering the books based on category/genre
-Using redux store management to add a book throught user-inputs
-Integrating a mock data
-Adding a responsive layout through react components
